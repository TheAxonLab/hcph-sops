### Preparing Ubuntu for *Psychopy*

??? important "*Psychopy* is preferably installed in a pure *Python* environment"

    If an anaconda environment is activated, run the following command to deactivate it:
    ``` shell
    conda deactivate
    ```

- [ ] Ensure your Ubuntu system has all necessary dependencies:
    ``` shell
    sudo apt install python3-dev \
                     libgtk-4-dev \
                     libgstreamer1.0-dev \
                     libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
                     freeglut3-dev \
                     libwebkitgtk-6.0-dev \
                     libjpeg8-dev \
                     libpng-dev \
                     libtiff-dev \
                     libsdl1.2-dev \
                     libnotify-dev \
                     libsm-dev
    ```

    ??? warning "Multiple screens"

        If you want to use multiple screens, install the corresponding libxcb extension:

        ``` shell
        sudo apt-get install libxcb-xinerama0
        ```

- [ ] Create a *Python* virtual environment:
    ``` shell
    python3 -m venv $HOME/psychopyenv
    ```
- [ ] Load the new virtual environment:
    ``` shell
    source $HOME/psychopyenv/bin/activate
    ```
- [ ] Update *Pypi* and *setuptools* to the latest version:
    ``` shell
    python -m pip install -U pip setuptools six wheel
    ```
- [ ] Update *Numpy* to the latest version:
    ``` shell
    python -m pip install -U numpy
    ```
- [ ] Download the *wxPython* sources:
    ``` shell
    python -m pip download wxPython
    ```
- [ ] Build *wxPython* (version of package may change on your settings, edit accordingly):
    ``` shell
    python -m pip wheel -v wxPython-{{ settings.psychopy.wxPython }}.tar.gz  2>&1 | tee build.log
    ```
- [ ] Install the wheel you just created:
    ``` shell
    python -m pip install wxPython-{{ settings.psychopy.wxPython }}-<python-version>-linux_x86_64.whl
    ```
- [ ] Test the installation (an empty window should we created without errors):
    ``` shell
    python -c "import wx; a=wx.App(); wx.Frame(None,title='hello world').Show(); a.MainLoop();"
    ```
- [ ] Install our *HCPh-signals* package (assumes these SOPs are checked out at `{{ secrets.data.sops_clone_path | default('<path>') }}`:
    ``` shell
    cd {{ secrets.data.sops_clone_path | default('<path>') }}/code/signals
    python -m pip install .
    ```

### *Psychopy* installation
This block describes how to prepare an environment with a running *Psychopy 3* installation.

??? important "Make sure to load the correct environment"

    - [ ] Deactivate conda (if active):
        ``` shell
        conda deactivate
        ```
    - [ ] Load the new virtual environment:
        ``` shell
        source $HOME/psychopyenv/bin/activate
        ```

- [ ] Clone the [*Psychopy* repository](https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy):
    ``` shell
    git clone https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy.git
    ```
- [ ] Navigate to the *Psychopy* directory and check-out tag `{{ settings.psychopy.version }}`:
    ``` shell
    cd psychopy
    git checkout {{ settings.psychopy.version }}
    ```
- [ ] Install *Psychopy* using the following command:
    ``` shell
    python -m pip install .[suggested]
    ```
- [ ] Install the *EyeLink* plugin for *Psychopy*:
    ``` shell
    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/oesteban/psychopy-eyetracker-eyelink.git
    ```

    ??? tip "On MacOSX or if you don't have access to pip directly, *Psychopy*'s package manager"

        Open *Psychopy* as mentioned immediately below.
        Click *Tools* â¤· *Plugin/Packages manager...*, then go to the *Packages* tab and hit the <span class="keypress">Open PIP terminal</span> button (bottom left area).
        There, you can type:
        ``` shell
        pip install git+https://github.com/oesteban/psychopy-eyetracker-eyelink.git
        ```

- [ ] Install the *Pylink* module made by *SR Research*, it is distributed with the [installation of the `eyelink-display-software`](setup.md#installing-eyelink-eye-tracker-software) done previously:

    ``` shell
    python -m pip install /usr/share/EyeLink/SampleExperiments/Python/wheels/sr_research_pylink-2.1.762.0-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
    ```

    ??? warning "Find the appropriate version for your *Python* distribution"

        The example above is for *cPython* 3.10, alternative installations are:

        ```
        /usr/share/EyeLink/SampleExperiments/Python/wheels/sr_research_pylink-2.1.762.0-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl
        /usr/share/EyeLink/SampleExperiments/Python/wheels/sr_research_pylink-2.1.762.0-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
        /usr/share/EyeLink/SampleExperiments/Python/wheels/sr_research_pylink-2.1.762.0-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl
        /usr/share/EyeLink/SampleExperiments/Python/wheels/sr_research_pylink-2.1.762.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
        /usr/share/EyeLink/SampleExperiments/Python/wheels/sr_research_pylink-2.1.762.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl
        /usr/share/EyeLink/SampleExperiments/Python/wheels/sr_research_pylink-2.1.762.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
        /usr/share/EyeLink/SampleExperiments/Python/wheels/sr_research_pylink-2.1.762.0-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl
        ```

- [ ] Try opening *Psychopy* by typing:
    ``` shell
    psychopy --no-splash -b
    ```

    ??? warning "Check that the *EyeLink* eye tracker is available in the dropdown under the experiment's options"

        If the *EyeLink* is not available, most likely the appropriate *Pylink* is missing.
        See the last checkbox in the [installation of the eye tracker](setup.md#preparing-the-stimuli-presentation-laptop-hos68752) to install it.
        Otherwise, make sure you installed the *EyeLink* plugin above.

    ??? important "The first time it runs, *Psychopy* will likely request some increased permissions"

        - [ ] Add a new `psychopy` group to your system.
            ``` shell
            sudo groupadd --force psychopy
            ```
        - [ ] Add your current user to the new group:
            ``` shell
            sudo usermod -a -G psychopy $USER
            ```
        - [ ] Raise security thresholds for *Psychopy*, by inserting the following into `/etc/security/limits.d/99-psychopylimits.conf`:
            ``` text
            @psychopy - nice -20
            @psychopy - rtprio 50
            @psychopy - memlock unlimited
            ```

??? bug "*Psychopy* crashes when trying to run a experiment: `pyglet.gl.ContextException: Could not create GL context`"

    This is likely related to your computer having a GPU and a nonfunctional configuration:

    ``` shell
    $ glxinfo | grep PyOpenGL
    X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
      Major opcode of failed request:  151 (GLX)
      Minor opcode of failed request:  24 (X_GLXCreateNewContext)
      Value in failed request:  0x0
      Serial number of failed request:  110
      Current serial number in output stream:  111
    ```

    A quick attempt to solve this would be adding our user to the `video` group.

    However, that is unlikely to work out so you'll need to take more actions (see [this](https://github.com/mmatl/pyrender/issues/13), and [this](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1255841/how-do-i-fix-the-glxinfo-badvalue-error-on-ubuntu-18-04))

??? bug "*Psychopy* crashes when trying to run a experiment: `qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin 'xcb'`"

    If you installed `libxcb-xinerama0`, or you don't have multiple screens, first try:

    ``` shell
    python -m pip uninstall opencv-python
    python -m pip install opencv-python-headless
    ```

    If that doesn't work, try a brute force solution by installing libxcb fully:

    ``` shell
    sudo apt-get install libxcb-*
    ```

??? bug "*Psychopy* does not recognize the *SR Research* eye tracker"

    If the eye tracker does not appear in the corresponding dropdown menu or your experiments fail [as described in this issue](https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/issues/5947), you almost certainly need to check the plugin is installed and available within *Psychopy*'s environment.

### Setting up the synchronization service as a daemon in the background

!!! important "It's fundamental to have a reliable means of communication with the BIOPAC digital inputs"

    The following guidelines set up a little service on a linux box that keeps listening for key presses (mainly, the <span class="keypress">s</span> trigger from the trigger box), and RPC (remote procedure calls) from typically *Psychopy* or similar software.

    The service is spun up automatically when you connect the MMBT-S modem interface that communicates with the BIOPAC (that is, the *N-shaped pink box*)

- [ ] To automatically start the program when the BIOPAC is connected, create a udev rule as follows:
    ``` shell
    sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-forward-trigger.rules
    ```
- [ ] Add the following rule to the file:
    ```
    ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="ttyACM0", SUBSYSTEM=="tty", TAG+="systemd", ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}="forward-trigger.service"
    ```
- [ ] Save the file and exit the editor.
- [ ] Run the following command to reload the udev rules:
    ``` shell
    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
    ```
- [ ] Create a systemd service unit file:
    ``` shell
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/forward-trigger.service
    ```
- [ ] Add the following content to the file (Adapt the path to `forward-trigger-service.py` to the location on your computer):
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Forward Trigger Service
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/forward-trigger-service.py
    WorkingDirectory=/path/to/forward-trigger/directory
    StandardOutput=null

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
- [ ] Save the file and exit the text editor.
- [ ] Run the following command to enable the service to start at boot:
    ``` shell
    sudo systemctl enable forward-trigger
    ```
- [ ] Run the following command to reload the systemd daemon:
    ``` shell
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

## Conversion of ET recordings into BIDS

EyeLink's EDF recording files will be accessed with [*PyEDFRead*](https://github.com/oesteban/pyedfread).
Please note, we will be using [@oesteban](https://github.com/oesteban)'s fork to include two bugfixes that, at the time of writing this document, have not been made it into the codebase of *PyEDFRead*.

- [ ] Install *PyEDFRead* on the computer where the ET conversion into BIDS will be executed.

    ``` python
    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/oesteban/pyedfread.git@master
    ```

    !!! warning "*PyEDFRead* requires the EyeLink SDK be installed as described [here](../data-collection/setup.md#installing-eyelink-eye-tracker-software)"
