Describe the location (e.g., university campus, hospital, community, city, zipcode area, etc.) of recruitment. Update this document describing the strategy for participant recruitment. Please beware that local ethical review boards may have some guidelines regarding the conditions that apply to recruitment tools and procedures. Some example strategies of recruitment are: Consecutive ongoing recruitment through principal investigator in daily clinical practice . Participant recruitment through referring physician . Advertisement/flyer (in this case, add the corresponding files under assets/ and link them from the body of this document). Describe whether participants' information will be pulled from some existing database, or collected into a newly created database. If a database or will be used, describe how to gain access to it and how to operate it. Describe the mechanisms to contact participants: If contact if over telephone, write down a script for the call If contact is over e-mail or postal mail, write down the communication template Screening Every new candidate participant must be screened to assess they meet all the inclusion criteria of your study, as well as do not meet any of the exclusion criteria. Your SOPs should clearly state: Refer to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study protocol, highlighting important aspects of the study (e.g., we are only investigating twins). Describe how the screening must be conducted. Prepare a checklist with all the elements that the candidate participant must be walked through if they accept to participate, for example: Confirm that participant does not have any contraindications List of obvious implants and medical devices (e.g., peacemaker in an MRI experiment) List of less-obvious circumstances that may disqualify participation, such as non-removable orthodontia, or home-made tattoos. Please note that minor implants (such as metal braces, retainers and some palatal expanders) that are sufficiently secured to the body may be safe on clinical MR scanners at 1.5T and 3T (tesla). However, these implants may originate artifacts on the generated images if they cause large-enough discontinuity of magnetic properties. Confirm that participant will accept the participation conditions described in the informed consent form, for example: If they will be required to abstain from eating, consuming coffee or smoking within a window of time prior to the exam. If their data will be openly shared after proper privacy protection measures. If they want to be informed about relevant incidental findings (and whether they can give up on their right to learn about them). Report life events that are relevant to the experiment and may be cause of stopping the participation for safety and health reasons (e.g., pregnancy) or other reasons (i.e., incompatibility with the study). Remind participant of any incompatibilities with the experiment that may apply (e.g., jewelry, removable orthodontics, some hairstyling products, etc.). If allowed to wear street clothes, remind participant to avoid clothing with metal or that would uncomfortable to lie in for the duration of the scan If participant has indicated nervousness or history of claustrophobia, or they belong to a population at risk (e.g., infants), anticipate the scheduling of a preparation session on a mock scanner prior to the first acquisition. Scheduling Participants will likely need to visit your facilities for the development of the study in one or more occasions. State the number and nature of each of the sessions. Indicate how the scheduling should be conducted with each participant. Establish a system to store and share the information on how the research team will be made aware of the schedule and its changes Clearly explain how to book shared resources utilized by the study (e.g., MRI scanner).","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"recruitment-scheduling-screening/example1/","text":"Example 1: Recruitment through flyer \u00b6","title":"Example 1"},{"location":"recruitment-scheduling-screening/example1/#example-1-recruitment-through-flyer","text":"","title":"Example 1: Recruitment through flyer"},{"location":"recruitment-scheduling-screening/example2/","text":"Example 2: Recruitment pool \u00b6 ( Example adapted from the DMCC Project ) Recruitment \u00b6 Notes about recruitment pools: We currently have access to several different recruitment pools, and were released participants at approximately 3 different time points (6 clustering together). Participants released to us through STRATA expire every 6 months, so in order to have continued access to these participants, we must renew them about a month before they expire. To contact participants, log in to STRATA tracking by logging into the medical school VPN (use cisco anyconnect app and type \u201cmsvpn.wusm.wustl.edu\u201d as the address), proceeding with username and password to access the VPN Navigate on chrome to \u201cstrata.wustl.edu\u201d and follow the link on the homepage to the tracking system Log in using STRATA username and password Choose \u201cDMCC2\u201d when prompted to choose a study (FOR BOTH DMCC2 and 3) Search for participant in database either by name or MFR ID (which is listed in the recruitment spreadsheet from Box that should be open on your desktop) and once participant is located, select by clicking \u201cview subject\u201d while name is highlighted to navigate to subject page Look under the \u201cPhones\u201d section to find the best calling number. Call the number listed on the lab telephone (dial 9 before the number to make external calls [numbers with 314 area code], dial 91 before the number to make long distance calls) to get a hold of the subject. Use the DMCC phone script (found in myIRB, within DMCC3 IRB's attachments) to conduct the screening procedure. Screening \u00b6 Within the call, follow the screening procedure: Print and label phone script with participant's MFR ID and record participant responses to questions on script. Make sure that the participant's questions about the study are all addressed and answered. If participant consents to the phone screen, conduct it and mark the results (screener date, if responded \u201cyes\u201d to any medical questions, whether or not passed screener) in the appropriate columns of the recruitment spreadsheet. Make sure to address any \u201cyes\u201d responses to medical questions by following up with the questions provided at the back of the screener. For HCP participants, also ask if their condition has changed since the HCP scans. For new participants, ask about past MRI experience and any changes medically since then. Make sure to ask about MBSR availability and commitment. In order for both MZ twins to be enrolled in test-retest w/ MBSR, we will need the twin counterbalanced for the MBSR intervention to commit to the time demands of an MBSR class at some point in the future (without divulging which group they are sorted into). If the candidate participant does not pass the phone screen, then end the interview, informing them that they do not meet our inclusion criteria, and mark the screen fail in the recruitment spreadsheet. If an MZ non-HCP twin, this excludes their twin too. If an MZ HCP twin, can still run as an individual if one twin fails. If participant does pass the phone screen, mark the results in the recruitment spreadsheet and attempt to schedule a time for the participant to come in and complete the study (continue with the next subsection). Scheduling \u00b6 To schedule the participant, coordinate with p to find a time that works with their schedule that also is reserved for the Braver lab on the Prisma calendar. To see which times are reserved for the Braver lab on the Prisma, check the Google Calendar \u201cDMCC HCP Scanning\u201d. The slots that are available will say \u201cunfilled scan slot\u201d.

If yes, record and add to p's subject page in STRATA. If not, gather participant's mailing address or establish some other alternative way to contact p with the important address and driving information for the appointment. Try to schedule sessions all within one week of each other, if possible. Before ending the call, ensure that the participant has a phone number to contact in case they need to call back with questions or concerns. Once the call is concluded: Record the results of the phone contact in STRATA by copying the number used to contact p (even if p was not reached or a voicemail was left instead of successful contact) and press \u201cnew\u201d under the Contacts section of the participant page, pasting the number in the body of the note and indicating whether or not p was reached and the outcome of the phone call, marking the relevant tracking code.
