Experimental design of the Cohort I.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven a valuable, non-invasive way of probing both the architecture and activity of the brain in-vivo, with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to understand many aspects of its function. Although a large body of literature has shown strong correlations between structural and functional networks at the larger scales [1-4], the accumulated unreliability of MRI measurements from the scanner and through further steps of the research workflow impedes the link between structure, function, and dynamics at clinically relevant spatial and temporal scales. In particular, the measurements obtained with MRI are highly indirect, spatiotemporally uncertain, and are confounded by other sources of MR signal. This complexity provides an immense informatics challenge that crosses multiple imaging modalities, including structural, functional, and dynamic connectivity approaches to understanding the human brain. Nonetheless, functional and structural networks extracted from MRI have proven sufficient levels of reliability to discriminate between individuals [4-7], and such reliability has proven stable from months to years [8]. Therefore, it is critical to characterize the reliability of this network\u2019s phenotyping before these analytical approaches may be applied clinically [9, 10]. In this project, we will first optimize the research workflow of MR network analyses to maximize the reliability of functional and structural connectivity matrices (so-called connectomes). Indeed, these matrices have been shown to contain large ratios of false positives and false negatives in both the functional [11] and the structural [12, 13] cases.  We hypothesize that such improvements in sensitivity and specificity of functional and structural networks generalize across scanners and subjects, allowing the univocal identification of individuals from their brain\u2019s networks (\"fingerprinting\"). In order to be able to statistically separate and characterize the sources of signal variation, the project involves acquiring large amounts of repeated data on a small number of individuals. This approach has recently been dubbed \"precision MRI\" [14] and focuses on individual differences rather than group differences. The data acquisition approach is structured in three efforts with varying numbers of subjects, repetitions, and scanning devices. The first two, called \"Cohort I\" and \"Cohort II\" are sequential in time, and collected on three different devices. Cohort I involves a single individual who will undergo a total of 60 scanning sessions. Subsequently, Cohort II involves six (6) individuals and a total of twelve (12) sessions each. Finally, \"Cohort III\" is a quality control set involving 18 individuals and a total of two sessions each in a single scanner. In total, the project plans for repeated MRI acquisition on 25 healthy, adult human subjects, across three different 3.0 Tesla (T) MRI scanners available at CHUV. In addition to the new data, the project will reuse existing, open-access data to pilot various aspects of the MRI processing and analysis workflow to further support the overall reliability of the findings.</p>"},{"location":"#impact","title":"Impact","text":"<p>Overall, this project will equip researchers with a framework for the extraction of reliable and precise structural, functional and dynamic networks that permit their joint modeling and analysis with interpretable and reproducible methods. The project will publicly release two highly valuable datasets necessary for the improvement of the workflow for structural and functional network extraction under open access and reuse terms. Upon conclusion, this study will mark a turning point for MRI research as a fundamental resource for academic training and a necessary assessment to unlock clinical applications in the long-term with the improvement of the reliability of MRI-network analyses. At a local scale, the project will substantially contribute to ensuring the reliability of the MRI clinical workflow that routinely aids medical decisions at CHUV.</p>"},{"location":"#pre-registration","title":"Pre-registration","text":"<p>The experiments and hypotheses associated to the collection of Cohorts I and II will be pre-registered to further guarantee research rigour and seek early scrutiny and feedback from experts in the field, thereby generating consensus on data collection and analysis. Researchers increasingly perceive pre-registration as a tool to maximize research transparency, improve study planning, and eliminate incentives conducive to dubious practices in the search for positive outcomes. By pre-registering the study, we will maximize the impact and usefulness of this work. A report on the Cohort I collection is undergoing pre-registration. Similarly, a report on Cohort II will be similarly submitted to suitable journal or organization (such as the Peer Community in Registered Reports, PCIRR) for peer-review. Additional reports and public communications of results of this project will be pre-registered whenever that is possible.</p>"},{"location":"#references","title":"References","text":"<p>[1]: P.

There is no need for you to endure uncomfortable experiences or anxiety (for instance, if you feel claustrophobic)</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"data-collection/participant-prep/#describing-the-development-of-the-session","title":"Describing the development of the session","text":"<ul> <li> <p> Describe the participant how the session will develop, with special attention to tasks. In the first session, show the task while explaining them for clarity. Let them interrupt you to ask for clarifications and answer all the questions that may arise.</p> Script for the first session <p>We are going to acquire three types of images. The first type is anatomical imaging that we use to study the morphology of the brain. The second type is diffusion MRI, which we use to infer the pathways of major fiber bundles showing how the different regions of the brain may be interconnected. Finally, we collect functional MRI, which we use to understand how the brain activates as a response to stimuli we will present to you. During the whole duration of the exam, please do not create closed loops by crossing your legs or holding your hands together. It is possible that your peripheral nerves get stimulated at some points, so you will feel twitching of muscles, for instance, of your pectorals. Do not panic, it is okay, but if it feels too uncomfortable, please squeeze the alarm button.</p> <p>For the anatomical and the diffusion MRI we just ask you to relax and try to stay as still and comfortable as possible. Like a photographic camera, the largest problem making analyses difficult is motion. As opposed to a photo camera, the imaging of the brain happens very slow so there is a lot of opportunity for involuntary movements (e.g., when you blink or you take a deeper breath) or semi-voluntary (e.g., you need to swallow).</p> <p>The functional MRI is a bit more entertaining, as we will ask you to engage in different behavioral activities. The first functional block is what we call a positive-control task, that will tell us little about your brain but will help us determine if there are confounding signals intermixed with your data. In this positive-control task, you will be shown a fixation point with the shape of a circle. Whenever you see that fixation point, please focus your gaze at the center of it. At points the fixation point will browse around the screen. When that happens, please follow it with your eyes taking care of not moving your head with the eye movement. Other times it will be fixed on the center, and have a blank gray background or a flickering or grating circular area behind it. The last element of this block will show the words LEFT or RIGHT. When either appears, please tap your thumb on each of the your other four fingers of the hand designated by the word, sequentially with all fingers and reversing the direction at the extremes (your pointer and your pinkie). This positive-control task has an approximate lentgh of 2 minutes. During this task, please leave the alarm button on your tummy, where you can recover it when it finishes.</p> <p>Then there is a long block of about 20 minutes that we call resting state. During this block, all you have to do is stay still and look at the movie. Please do not close your eyes.</p> <p>Finally, a breath-holding task will help us understand the signals elicited by your breathing that are detected by the scanner. This block has a length of about 6 minutes. You will watch five repeats of the same block. Each block will show you a colored rectangle in the middle. The green rectangle means breathe in, the yellow rectangle means breathe out, and the red rectangle means hold your breath. The last two green and yellow rectangle will be shown on a lighter green and orange color respectively to signal you that a hold will follow immediately after the breathe-out. The red rectangle will turn pink to indicate that you will soon be able to breathe-out any remaining air in your lungs and breathe in again. Please remember to breathe out after the breath-hold. When no rectangle is presented, you can breathe as it feels more comfortable to you. The first of the blocks is a mock. That will be reminded to you at the beginning of the task on the screen. During the mock block, please look at the stimuli on the screen but keep your habitual breathing pace disregarding the task instructions. At the end of this mock block, a message will remind you must follow the task instructions from that moment on. that you must adapt your breathing to the pace indicated by the color-changing rectangle in the center of the screen for the remaining four repetitions of the block.</p> <p>Is everything clear to you? Do you have any questions?</p> Script for the following sessions <p>As you probably remember, we acquire three types of images. For two of them you just stay still in the scanner, but we will also require your collaboration for the third, which is functional MRI. During the whole duration of the exam, please do not create closed loops by crossing your legs or holding your hands together. It is possible that your peripheral nerves get stimulated at some points, so you will feel twitching of muscles, for instance, of your pectorals. Do not panic, it is okay, but if it feels too uncomfortable, please squeeze the alarm button.</p> <p>Let's quickly recap the functional MRI tasks. The first is the positive-control task, you will be shown a fixation point with the shape of a circle that you must follow with your gaze wherever it goes and then the words LEFT or RIGHT while which you tap your fingers like this (remind to them). During this task, please leave the alarm button on your tummy, where you can recover it when it finishes.</p> <p>Then there is a long block of about 20 minutes that we call resting state, where you will be watching a movie. During this block, all you have to do is stay still and please do not close your eyes.</p> <p>Finally, the breath-holding task where you will watch five repeats of the same block with colored rectangles in the middle.

Do not touch the surface of the ET mirror.</p> <p></p> <p>The infrared mirror MUST be airtight attached</p> <p>It is critical that there is no air gap between the infrared mirror and the standard mirror. Also, make sure the scotch tape is firmly glued to the standard mirror because the infrared mirror will be hanging when placed on the coil and may loosen up creating a gap with the standard mirror.</p> <p>Suggestion</p> <p>Since we are going to track the right eye only, it is useful to displace the infrared mirror to the right from the participant's standpoint and cut the scotch tape narrower to occlude less surface of the mirrors on the right side.</p> </li> <li> <p> Place the mirror frame back on the head coil.

Le but de cet appel est de vous r\u00e9p\u00e9ter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments importants concernant le projet. Ensuite nous allons v\u00e9rifier ensemble que vous \u00eates d\u2019accord avec toutes les exigences pour participer \u00e0 ce projet et nous allons v\u00e9rifier que vous n\u2019avez pas de contre-indications qui vous emp\u00eachent de passer des sessions IRM. De plus, je suis aussi l\u00e0 pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 toutes vos questions, donc n'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 m'interrompre si vous comprenez pas quelque chose ou si vous avez des doutes.</p> <p>Est-ce que vous avez des questions jusque l\u00e0 ?</p> <p>Je vais maintenant vous pr\u00e9senter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels concernant votre participation \u00e0 notre \u00e9tude. La participation \u00e0 ce projet comprend 12 s\u00e9ances d'environ 1h30 qui se d\u00e9rouleront au CHUV. Chaque s\u00e9ance durera environ 1h30. On commencera par remplir un bref questionnaire pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure, \u00e7a prendra environ 15 minutes ensuite, nous vous pr\u00e9pareront, nous vous expliquerons l\u2019examen et nous nous assurerons que vous ne portez rien qui puisse causer des perturbations magn\u00e9tiques. Nous v\u00e9rifierons \u00e9galement avec une liste de contr\u00f4le que toutes les mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sont prises et que vous n'avez pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment m\u00e9talliques sur vous. Ensuite vous passerez environ 1h15 dans le scanner.</p> <p>Dans chaque s\u00e9ance nous allons non seulement acqu\u00e9rir des images IRM mais nous allons aussi enregistrer des signaux physiologiques au moyen de quatres appareils suppl\u00e9mentaires. Ces appareils sont compatibles avec l\u2019IRM et ils n'affectent pas votre sant\u00e9.</p> <p>Le premier appareil est une ceinture respiratoire pour suivre votre respiration. C'est simplement une ceinture autour de votre ventre ou autour de votre thorax qui mesure le d\u00e9placement de votre ventre.</p> <p>Ensuite nous allons placer trois d\u2019\u00e9lectrodes au sommet de votre thorax. Ceux-ci sont plac\u00e9s avec un gel conducteur sur la peau pour mesurer vos pulsations cardiaques.</p> <p>Le troisi\u00e8me appareil est une canule respiratoire pour mesurer la concentration de dioxyde de carbone expir\u00e9. Une canule respiratoire c'est le tube que les personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es ont pour respirer de l'oxyg\u00e8ne. La diff\u00e9rence c\u2019est que nous n\u2019allons pas vous donner du gaz, mais simplement que vous expirez pendant votre respiration.</p> <p>Le 4\u00e8me appareil est un appareil pour mesurer le mouvement de vos pupilles. Cet appareil ne sera pas sur vous et n'a aucun effet ni sur votre sant\u00e9 ni sur votre confort. Durant toute la s\u00e9ance d'IRM, vous tiendrez un bouton alarme dans votre main, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'\u00e0 n'importe quel moment si vous avez un probl\u00e8me vous pouvez appuyer sur ce bouton d'alarme et nous interrompons l\u2019examen imm\u00e9diatement et venons vous chercher \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du scanner pour voir avec vous ce qui ne va pas. Vous pouvez interrompre une session \u00e0 tout moment sans explication.</p> <p>Est-ce que vous avez des questions? Non, alors continuous.</p> <p>Les risques li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'IRM sont les suivants.</p> <p>l\u2019IRM est un fort champ magn\u00e9tique, il est donc dangereux de rentrer dans la salle avec des objets \u00e0 susceptibilit\u00e9 magn\u00e9tique. C'est pourquoi plus tard nous allons minutieusement v\u00e9rifier ensemble la liste du questionnaire de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 IRM. Toutefois en l\u2019absence d\u2019object \u00e0 susceptibilit\u00e9 magn\u00e9tique, l\u2019IRM est compl\u00e8tement sans danger car il n\u2019utilise pas de rayonnement ionisant.  Il n'y a pas de danger m\u00eame si on fait beaucoup de s\u00e9ances.</p> <p>Sachez que le tunnel est relativement \u00e9troit donc on peut se sentir un peu claustrophobique.</p> <p>Si vous \u00eates une femme, je dois vous informer qu\u2019avant la premi\u00e8re session vous allez devoir faire un test de grossesse. C'est pour v\u00e9rifier que vous n'\u00eates pas enceinte, car \u00e9thiquement nous n'avons pas le droit de scanner des femmes enceintes car les effets des IRM sur le f\u0153tus n'ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail. Avant chaque s\u00e9ance vous devrez \u00e9galement de donner des informations sur vos r\u00e8gles comme le dernier jour des r\u00e8gles ainsi que la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de vos r\u00e8gles ceci est important car le cycle menstruel a un effet sur le cerveau et pour la fiabilit\u00e9 de notre \u00e9tude nous avons besoin de savoir ces informations. Toutefois sachez que vous pouvez d\u00e9cider d\u2019exclure les informations sur vos r\u00e8gles quand nous allons publier les donn\u00e9es publiquement.</p> <p>Les s\u00e9ances IRM seront programm\u00e9es en fonction de la disponibilit\u00e9 des appareils et des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences et de votre agenda. La dur\u00e9e de participation maximale est de 20 semaines cons\u00e9cutive, c'est-\u00e0-dire 5 mois, mais id\u00e9alement les sessions seront programm\u00e9es \u00e0 un interval r\u00e9gulier  Est-ce que vous avez des questions jusque-l\u00e0 ?</p> <p>Ok donc maintenant je veux juste v\u00e9rifier avec vous que vous \u00eates d'accord avec toutes les exigences concernant la participation \u00e0 ce projet. Est-ce que vous \u00eates \u00e2g\u00e9s entre 24 et 55 ans ? Vous n'\u00eates pas diagnostiquer avec un trouble ou une maladie neurologique ? Vous acceptez d'\u00eatre inform\u00e9 des d\u00e9couvertes fortuites concernant votre sant\u00e9? Parce que on a l'obligation \u00e9thique d'envoyer les images de la premi\u00e8re session \u00e0 un radiologue qui va v\u00e9rifier ces images et vous informer s'il d\u00e9couvre quelque chose d'anormal dans votre cerveau. Ensuite un \u00e9l\u00e9ment tr\u00e8s important, c'est que vous devez accepter que vos donn\u00e9es soient publier ouvertement, mais bien s\u00fbr apr\u00e8s que nous ayons appliqu\u00e9 des mesures ad\u00e9quates de protection de la confidentialit\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es. Par exemple, nous allons enlever toute informations qui permettraient de vous reconnaitre comme votre nom, votre date de naissance ou la date de l\u2019examen afin de prot\u00e9ger votre confidentialit\u00e9. Etes-vous d'accord avec ce terme ? Un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment important est que la participation \u00e0 cette \u00e9tude implique de nombreuses sessions IRM. Comme je vous ai dit 12 sessions d'environ 1h30. Donc s'il vous pla\u00eet, veuillez vous demander si l'engagement pour le projet n'est pas excessif ou pourrait devenir lourd avec le temps et que vous avez amplement le temps pour finir le projet. Vous devez aussi accepter de nous informer si vous prenez des m\u00e9dicaments, si vous consommez de l\u2019alcool ou de la drogue car ces substances ont un effet important sur le cerveau et nous avons besoin de savoir pour pouvoir quantifier ces effets.</p> <p>Une autre contrainte c'est que vous devez \u00e9viter de boire du caf\u00e9 4h avant les s\u00e9ances car le caf\u00e9 aussi est connu pour avoir des effets notables sur le cerveau.</p> <p>Maintenant qu\u2019on a confirm\u00e9 que vous \u00eates d'accord avec toutes ces exigences, je vous rappelle que votre participation est enti\u00e8rement libre et que vous pouvez vous retirer \u00e0 tout moment sans explication. Toutefois pour nous c'est important que les participants finissent les 12 sessions pour la compl\u00e9tude de nos donn\u00e9es et donc pour nous c'est mieux si vous \u00eates d\u00e9termin\u00e9s \u00e0 finir les 12 sessions et que c'est seulement si il y a quelque chose d'urgent ou d\u2019impr\u00e9vu que vous interrompez votre participation.</p> <p>Chaque s\u00e9ance sera r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 45 francs plus les frais de transport.</p> <p>Des questions ?</p> <p>OK maintenant nous pouvons regarder ensemble le questionnaire de contr\u00f4le de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et v\u00e9rifier que vous avez r\u00e9pondu non \u00e0 toutes les questions.</p> <p>Avez-vous r\u00e9pondu oui \u00e0 une des questions ? Non ok parfait.</p> <p>Je veux juste rev\u00e9rifier avec vous que vous n\u2019avez bien pas d'aide auditive.</p> <p>Vous n'avez pas de bac dentaire, de proth\u00e8se dentaire, de fausses dents etc. Vous n'avez pas non plus de piercing de tatouage ou de maquillage permanent ni d\u2019implant capillaire Vous n'avez jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 par un objet m\u00e9tallique. Vous n'avez pas subi des op\u00e9rations dans lesquelles il y aurait des m\u00e9taux qui restent dans votre corps comme des clips chirurgicaux, des agrafes, des fixations vert\u00e9brale, un stimulateur de la moelle \u00e9pini\u00e8re, des extendeurs de tissu Vous ne portez pas de valve cardiaque. Vous portez pas de biostimulateur, de pompe \u00e0 m\u00e9dicament interne ou externe, de cath\u00e9ters ou d'articulation artificielle.</p> <p>C\u2019est parfait, vous \u00eates \u00e9ligible \u00e0 participer.</p> <p>Encore quelques instructions \u00e0 suivre avant chaque la s\u00e9ance. Il faut retirer tous les bijoux, piercing compris, et tous les accessoires de cheveux. Veuillez aussi retirer vos proth\u00e8ses dentaires, les fausses dents etc. Il faut \u00e9galement retirer les aides auditives et les lunettes. Si vous \u00eates un homme, veuillez s'il vous pla\u00eet vous raser la partie sup\u00e9rieure du torse car nous avons besoin de placer les \u00e9lectrodes \u00e0 m\u00eame la peau pour bien enregistrer le signal.</p> <p>Voil\u00e0 c\u2019est toutes les informations que j\u2019ai \u00e0 vous partager. Est-ce que vous avez des questions?</p> <p>En tout cas merci beaucoup pour votre participation! Si vous avez des questions, des doutes, n'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 me rappeler \u00e0 ce num\u00e9ro et je vous rappelle dans quelques jours afin de fixer la premi\u00e8re session.</p> <p>Bonne journ\u00e9e.</p> <p>Au revoir.</p>"},{"location":"recruitment-scheduling-screening/scheduling/","title":"Scheduling","text":"<ul> <li> <p> Iteratively draw participants from the recruitment shortlist and call them back to set their first session.</p> <p>Stop calling potential participants when the sample size has been achieved</p> <p>Once the sample size is filled (e.g., 3M/3F for Cohort II), call the remainder of the participants in the shortlist to let them know that they have been moved into the wait list.</p> </li> <li> <p> The first session will always happen at MRI 1 (PrismaFit, \u2588\u2588\u2588)</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"recruitment-scheduling-screening/scheduling/#scheduling-of-the-prismafit-system","title":"Scheduling of the PrismaFit system (\u2588\u2588\u2588)","text":"<p>Contact \u2588\u2588\u2588, MRI Operational Manager, for any doubts/problems regarding this system</p> <ul> <li> Open the \u2588\u2588\u2588 scheduling system (URL) on a browser.</li> <li> With the participant on the phone, find a suitable, empty slot by scrolling the calendar.</li> <li> Click on the preferred slot, make sure that selected resource is \u2588\u2588\u2588</li> <li> Select \u2588\u2588\u2588 in the Operator dropdown menu.</li> <li> Select the adequate length for the session (120 minutes)</li> <li> Select Research on healthy subjects in the Type of Scan box.</li> <li> Select true in Technician Required if you are not a certified operator of the system.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"recruitment-scheduling-screening/scheduling/#scheduling-of-the-vidafit-system","title":"Scheduling of the VidaFit system (\u2588\u2588\u2588)","text":"<p>Contact \u2588\u2588\u2588, Technical MRI Coordinator, for any doubts/problems regarding this system</p> <ul> <li> Open the \u2588\u2588\u2588 scheduling system (URL) on a browser.</li> <li> <p> With the participant on the phone, find a suitable, empty slot by scrolling the calendar.</p> <p>Clinical scanner hours are very restricted</p> <p>The study can only be executed on Fridays after 18h00</p> </li> <li> <p> Click on the preferred slot, make sure that selected resource is \u2588\u2588\u2588</p> </li> <li> Select \u2588\u2588\u2588 in the Operator dropdown menu.</li> <li> Select the adequate length for the session (60 minutes)</li> <li> Select Research on healthy subjects in the Type of Scan box.</li> <li> Select true in Technician Required.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"recruitment-scheduling-screening/scheduling/#scheduling-of-the-vida-system","title":"Scheduling of the Vida system (\u2588\u2588\u2588)","text":"<p>Only \u2588\u2588\u2588, Technical MRI Coordinator, can book this system.</p>"}]}
