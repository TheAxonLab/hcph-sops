Behind the rolling table, there is a transparent panel where the ET camera will be set up inside the scanner bore.</li> <li> Verify that the monitor and the cable, as well as the ET over the PC tower are fixed to the rolling table with scotch tape.</li> <li> Bring the table with the ET computer to the access closet (outside) of the scanner room. Be very attentive during the displacement and lift the front wheels when passing steps or cables. The transparent panel can also be brought to the scanning room simultaneously, if done with care.</li> <li> From room BH07/071 (first cabinet on the left), take the box with the \u00abfMRI usage\u00bb label, containing the ET camera, lenses, and the special infrared mirror. </li> <li> Take out of the lenses box the MR-Compatible lense.

The two back \"feet\" of Base of the ET have to be within two corners made of transparent scotch and already attached to the plexiglass.

Connect the cables (two plugs for the black, one plug for the orange).</li> <li> Open the door of the cable section between the recording room and the scanner room.</li> <li> First pass the optic fiber (orange wire) and the power cable (the one with a fabric sheet) through the access point (TODO: ATTACH PICTURE). This operation requires two people, one handling the cables from outside the scanner, and the other gently pulling them from inside. Both people will lift the cable to avoid its abrasion with the edges of the metallic cylinder, which is the passage between exterior and interior of the scanner room. Once the sliding of the cable is finished, leave the extremities inside the scanner room in the left-top corner, far from the scanner. These parts are magnetic.</li> <li> Place the plastic base into the bore of the MR, top side. DON\u2019T PUSH IT inside, it needs to be adjusted once the subject is placed inside the scanner, to ensure the repeatible positioning of the ET.</li> <li> Detach the mirror frame from the head coil, if it is placed there. Remove unnecessary items from the scanning bed, and prepare the mirror to attach the infrared mirror of the ET at a later step.</li> <li> Prepare two long stripes of scotch tape and leave them in a convenient place to then attach the ET mirror with them on to the standard mirror. E.g., attach the corner of each strip to the back part of the mirror frame.</li> <li> Take out the box containing the infrared mirror from the \u00abfMRI usage\u00bb box. DO NOT EXTRACT THE MIRROR OUT FROM ITS BOX YET. The mirror's box is labeled as RELIQUIA DI SAN GENNARO to emphasize that THIS IS THE MOST DELICATE PART, BECAUSE THE MIRROR CANNOT BE REPLACED NOR CLEANED. This mirror is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> Get two gloves (e.g., from the box hanging at the entrance of the scanner room), then approach the scanner bed. Put the gloves on, and DON\u2019T TOUCH ANYTHING. You MUST have the standard mirror dismounted and in front of you at this point. WITH THE GLOVES proceed to extract the infra-red mirror from its box, being extremely careful. YOU CAN ONLY TOUCH THE MIRROR WITH GLOVES, because it cannot be cleaned up. Watch out for FINGERPRINTS and once taken out of its box, IMMEDIATELY PROCEED TO ATTACH IT to the standard coil mirror. The mirror MUST NOT be placed anywhere else if not in its box.</li> <li> WITH YOUR GLOVES ON, attach the ET mirror to the standard coil mirror (the larger mirror that points toward projector's screen at the back of the scanning room). Put it more or less in the center, although this position may need to be adjusted (being careful and with the same precautions explained before) and stick it with the paper scotch.

If a database or will be used, describe how to gain access to it and how to operate it.</li> <li> Describe the mechanisms to contact participants:<ul> <li>If contact if over telephone, write down a script for the call</li> <li>If contact is over e-mail or postal mail, write down the communication template</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Screening</p> <p>Every new candidate participant must be screened to assess they meet all the inclusion criteria of your study, as well as do not meet any of the exclusion criteria.</p> <p>Your SOPs should clearly state:</p> <ul> <li> Refer to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study protocol, highlighting important aspects of the study (e.g., we are only investigating twins).</li> <li> Describe how the screening must be conducted.</li> <li> Prepare a checklist with all the elements that the candidate participant must be walked through if they accept to participate, for example:</li> <li> Confirm that participant does not have any contraindications<ul> <li> List of obvious implants and medical devices (e.g., peacemaker in an MRI experiment)</li> <li> List of less-obvious circumstances that may disqualify participation, such as non-removable orthodontia, or home-made tattoos.       Please note that minor implants (such as metal braces, retainers and some palatal expanders) that are sufficiently secured to the body may be safe on clinical MR scanners at 1.5T and 3T (tesla). However, these implants may originate artifacts on the generated images if they cause large-enough discontinuity of magnetic properties.</li> </ul> </li> <li> Confirm that participant will accept the participation conditions described in the informed consent form, for example:<ul> <li> If they will be required to abstain from eating, consuming coffee or smoking within a window of time prior to the exam.</li> <li> If their data will be openly shared after proper privacy protection measures.</li> <li> If they want to be informed about relevant incidental findings (and whether they can give up on their right to learn about them).</li> <li> Report life events that are relevant to the experiment and may be cause of stopping the participation for safety and health reasons (e.g., pregnancy) or other reasons (i.e., incompatibility with the study).</li> <li> Remind participant of any incompatibilities with the experiment that may apply (e.g., jewelry, removable orthodontics, some hairstyling products, etc.).</li> <li> If allowed to wear street clothes, remind participant to avoid clothing with metal or that would uncomfortable to lie in for the duration of the scan</li> <li> If participant has indicated nervousness or history of claustrophobia, or they belong to a population at risk (e.g., infants), anticipate the scheduling of a preparation session on a mock scanner prior to the first acquisition.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Scheduling</p> <p>Participants will likely need to visit your facilities for the development of the study in one or more occasions.</p> <ul> <li> State the number and nature of each of the sessions.</li> <li> Indicate how the scheduling should be conducted with each participant.</li> <li> Establish a system to store and share the information on how the research team will be made aware of the schedule and its changes</li> <li> Clearly explain how to book shared resources utilized by the study (e.g., MRI scanner).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"recruitment-scheduling-screening/example1/","title":"Example 1: Recruitment through flyer","text":""},{"location":"recruitment-scheduling-screening/example2/","title":"Example 2: Recruitment pool","text":"<p>(Example adapted from the DMCC Project)</p>"},{"location":"recruitment-scheduling-screening/example2/#recruitment","title":"Recruitment","text":"<p>Notes about recruitment pools: We currently have access to several different recruitment pools, and were released participants at approximately 3 different time points (6 clustering together).
