This operation requires two people, one handling the cables from outside the scanner, and the other gently pulling them from inside. Both people will lift the cable to avoid its abrasion with the edges of the metallic cylinder, which is the passage between exterior and interior of the scanner room. Once the sliding of the cable is finished, leave the extremities inside the scanner room in the left-top corner, far from the scanner. These parts are magnetic.</li> <li> Connect the cables (two plugs for the black, one plug for the orange).</li> <li> Take the half-circle one-direction screen from the table behind the scanner and put it on the back of the scanner, behind the ET system (don't push the plexiglas yet)</li> <li> Place the infrared mirror:<ul> <li> Detach the mirror frame from the head coil, if it is placed there. Remove unnecessary items from the scanning bed, and prepare the mirror to attach the infrared mirror of the ET at a later step.</li> <li> Prepare two long strips of scotch tape and leave them in a convenient place to attach the ET mirror later. E.g., attach the corner of each strip to the back part of the mirror frame.</li> <li> Go back to the control room and take the infrared mirror out of the \u00abfMRI usage\u00bb box. DO NOT EXTRACT THE MIRROR OUT FROM ITS BOX YET. The mirror's box is labeled as RELIQUIA DI SAN GENNARO to emphasize that THIS IS THE MOST DELICATE PART, BECAUSE THE MIRROR CANNOT BE REPLACED NOR CLEANED. This mirror is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.      </li> <li> Get two gloves (e.g., from the box hanging at the entrance of the scanner room), then approach the scanner bed. Put the gloves on, and DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING. You MUST have the standard mirror dismounted and in front of you at this point. WITH THE GLOVES proceed to extract the infra-red mirror from its box, being extremely careful. YOU CAN ONLY TOUCH THE MIRROR WITH GLOVES, because it cannot be cleaned up. Watch out for FINGERPRINTS and once taken out of its box, IMMEDIATELY PROCEED TO ATTACH IT to the standard coil mirror. The mirror MUST NOT be placed anywhere else if not in its box.</li> <li> WITH YOUR GLOVES ON, attach the ET mirror to the standard coil mirror (the larger mirror that points toward projector's screen at the back of the scanning room) using the scotch tape strips you prepared before. Put it more or less in the center, although this position may need to be adjusted (being careful and with the same precautions explained before).
